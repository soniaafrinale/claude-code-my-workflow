# CLAUDE.MD -- Academic Project Development with Claude Code

<!-- HOW TO USE: Keep this file under ~150 lines — Claude loads it every session.
     See the guide at docs/workflow-guide.html for full documentation. -->

**Project:** Empirical Economics Research Workspace (multi-project: papers, slides, analysis)
**Institution:** Independent researcher (unaffiliated)
**Branch:** main

## Scope Discipline

**Do exactly what was asked — nothing adjacent.** Do not add README files, build scripts,
`.gitignore` edits, helper utilities, or extra tooling that was not requested. If an addition
looks valuable, **list it as a suggestion at the end** and let the user decide.

A request for a codebook is a request for a codebook. Delivering a codebook plus a README plus
build scripts plus gitignore edits means the user now has to review four things to accept one,
and the usual outcome is that all four get thrown away.

**Before adding anything not named in the request, ask.** One line is cheaper than a revert.

## Core Principles

- **Plan first** -- enter plan mode before non-trivial tasks; save plans to `quality_reports/plans/`
- **Verify after** -- compile/render and confirm output at the end of every task
- **Single source of truth** -- Beamer `.tex` is authoritative; Quarto `.qmd` derives from it
- **Quality gates** -- nothing ships below 80/100
- **[LEARN] tags** -- when corrected, save `[LEARN:category] wrong → right` to [MEMORY.md](MEMORY.md)

Cross-session context lives in [MEMORY.md](MEMORY.md); past plans, specs, and session logs are in [quality_reports/](quality_reports/).

**How we verify** — the references and rules that carry the verification discipline:

- [`verification-ladder.md`](.claude/references/verification-ladder.md) — the seven rungs, from *qualify the checker* to the external oracle, and how the review loop converges.
- [`external-oracle-process.md`](.claude/references/external-oracle-process.md) — running an independent frontier-model referee (Claude Code → GPT-5.6 Sol Pro) and adjudicating what it returns.
- [`provenance-and-ground-truth.md`](.claude/references/provenance-and-ground-truth.md) — naming and pinning your oracles, classifying divergence, and the clean-room boundary.
- [`review-fencing.md`](.claude/rules/review-fencing.md) — reviewer independence is a property of the environment, not an instruction: a neutral copy outside the checkout, prior verdicts withheld, and the answer keys the repo already commits fenced off.
- [`release-engineering.md`](.claude/references/release-engineering.md) — shipping research software: message and silent-resolution censuses, frozen feature matrices for ports, hash-claimed inherited tests, and downstream consumers pinned by commit SHA.

**How we write** — [`writing-with-ai.md`](.claude/rules/writing-with-ai.md): internal vs external-facing documents, why a model cannot make its own output stop reading as model output, and the human-readable standard for anything with your name on it.

**Theory work** — [`theory-proving.md`](.claude/references/theory-proving.md): proof contracts, portfolio search with isolated explorers, counterexample-hunting your own lemmas, adversarial audits, and the rule that an AI-generated proof is a claim, not a theorem.

**The laws** — [`research-agent-laws.md`](.claude/references/research-agent-laws.md): 21 laws for running agents on research infrastructure, each paid for by a real incident.

**How we remember** — the record lives in the repo, not the transcript:

- [`progress-reports.md`](.claude/rules/progress-reports.md) — GitHub issues as defect memory, `quality_reports/` as work memory, `MEMORY.md` as lesson memory.
- [`issue-ledger.md`](.claude/rules/issue-ledger.md) — the evidence standard an issue must meet, and the seven-section closure comment.
- [`repo-hygiene.md`](.claude/rules/repo-hygiene.md) — **scratch must not become main.** Enforced by `check-repo-hygiene.py` on every commit.

Nothing clears work until it has a row in [`quality_reports/qualification/LEDGER.md`](quality_reports/qualification/LEDGER.md) — run [`/vaccinate`](.claude/skills/vaccinate/SKILL.md) to put one there.

## Commands

```bash
# LaTeX (3-pass, XeLaTeX only)
cd Slides && TEXINPUTS=../Preambles:$TEXINPUTS xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode file.tex
BIBINPUTS=..:$BIBINPUTS bibtex file
TEXINPUTS=../Preambles:$TEXINPUTS xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode file.tex
TEXINPUTS=../Preambles:$TEXINPUTS xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode file.tex

# Deploy Quarto to GitHub Pages
./scripts/sync_to_docs.sh LectureN

# Quality score
python scripts/quality_score.py Quarto/file.qmd

# Palette sync (LaTeX ↔ SCSS)
./scripts/check-palette-sync.sh

# Backtest: is the repo internally consistent and currently true?
# (surface-sync + skill-integrity + model-versions + links + spec-conformance + staleness + repo-hygiene + derived-counts + ledger-coverage + hook-battery)
# Run this after ANY change. Also runs in pre-commit and CI.
./scripts/backtest.sh
```

**Palette contract:** color names in `Preambles/header.tex` must match SCSS variables in `Quarto/theme-template.scss`. See [`Preambles/README.md`](Preambles/README.md).

## Quality Thresholds (advisory)

| Score | Checkpoint | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| 80 | Commit | Good enough to save |
| 90 | PR | Ready for deployment |
| 95 | Excellence | Aspirational |

Enforced by `/commit` (halts + asks for override) **and** — once you run `./scripts/install-hooks.sh` — by a real git pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`) that runs the full backtest gate suite plus the quality (≥80) gate on every commit. Bypass sparingly with `SKIP_QUALITY_GATE=1` or `--no-verify`.

## Skills Quick Reference

## Beamer Custom Macros

`Preambles/header.tex` defines color macros and one frame macro — no boxed `tcolorbox`
environments yet (Quarto has boxed CSS classes below with no Beamer equivalent; add matching
`tcolorbox` environments to `header.tex` when a deck needs them).

| Macro | Effect | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `\key{text}` | Bold, gold-colored | Key terms/results |
| `\good{text}` / `\bad{text}` | Green / red | Positive vs. problematic results |
| `\muted{text}` | Neutral gray | De-emphasized text |
| `\transitionslide{title}` | Full-bleed dark section-break frame | Section transitions |

## Quarto CSS Classes

Defined in `Quarto/theme-template.scss`.

| Class | Effect | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.keybox` / `.highlightbox` / `.methodbox` / `.assumptionbox` / `.quotebox` / `.resultbox` / `.eqbox` / `.softbox` | Bordered/colored callout boxes | Definitions, assumptions, results, quotes (max 2 boxes/slide — INV-7) |
| `.positive` / `.negative` / `.neutral` | Green / red / gray, bold | Good / bad / reference annotations |
| `.hi` / `.hi-gold` / `.hi-yellow` / `.hi-slate` / `.hi-green` / `.hi-red` | Colored inline emphasis | Highlighting a term inline |
| `.bigger` / `.smaller` / `.smallest` | 115% / 85% / smaller font | Adjusting density on a crowded or sparse slide |
| `.wide-table` / `.compact` | Full-width table / tightened spacing | Dense tables |

## Current Project State

No lecture or paper projects yet. `HelloWorld.tex` / `HelloWorld.qmd` is the setup-verification
sample (see `Slides/HelloWorld.tex`) — keep it until the first real deck compiles, then this
table tracks real projects: one row per lecture/paper, Beamer file, Quarto mirror (if any), and
a one-line description.

| Lecture / Paper | Beamer | Quarto | Key Content |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HelloWorld *(setup sample)* | `HelloWorld.tex` | `HelloWorld.qmd` | Minimal deck to verify setup |
